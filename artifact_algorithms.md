# Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement

For this enhancement, I focused on integrating an advanced algorithmic solution into *House Cleaning Adventure*. By choosing A* pathfinding, I demonstrated my ability to handle complex logic and make strategic decisions about data structures and heuristics, transforming the gameplay from static navigation to dynamic, intelligent agent behavior.

**Key Changes:**
- Implemented A* pathfinding for the agent to intelligently navigate rooms.
- Represented rooms and connections as a graph structure for effective traversal.
- Moved from a simpler BFS approach to a more efficient heuristic-driven algorithm.
- Implemented agent's "wait threshold" mechanic to add genuine challenge to the gameplay

**Outcome Alignment:**
- **Outcome 3:** A* pathfinding exemplifies designing and evaluating computing solutions using sound algorithmic principles, managing complexity and performance trade-offs.
- **Outcome 4:** Employing a well-regarded algorithm and data structures reflects innovative, value-oriented computational techniques.

**Reflections:**
Switching from BFS to A* broadened my understanding of heuristic-driven algorithms. Although challenging, the adaptation improved my problem-solving skills and highlighted the importance of choosing the right approach to achieve the desired functionality and efficiency.
