For the final enhancement, I integrated a database into *House Cleaning Adventure*. Expanding beyond a static codebase, I introduced persistent storage for user accounts, high scores, and game states, reflecting a shift towards a professional-level application aligned with real-world industry requirements.

**Key Changes:**
- Implemented a SQLite database for persistent data storage.
- Created a `database.py` module and adapted classes to interact seamlessly with the database.
- Added user authentication with password hashing, secure input validation, and high score tracking.

**Outcome Alignment:**
- **Outcome 3:** Integrating the database required careful architectural decisions and managing evolving requirements.
- **Outcome 4:** Using SQLite and secure coding practices shows employing well-founded tools for delivering industry-specific value.
- **Outcome 5:** Anticipating vulnerabilities and ensuring data privacy demonstrates a proactive security mindset.

**Reflections:**
Though ambitious, this enhancement deepened my understanding of persistent storage, user management, and secure coding. Revisiting concepts like login systems linked past learnings into a cohesive skill set, making this artifact a comprehensive demonstration of my development as a computing professional.
