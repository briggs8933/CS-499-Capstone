# Professional Self-Assessment

As I near the completion of the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have taken the opportunity to reflect on the capstone experience and the journey 
that led me here. Throughout my education, I transitioned from writing simple scripts to developing well-structured, secure, and efficient 
applications demonstrating deep technical knowledge and professional readiness. Completing my coursework and assembling this ePortfolio has helped 
me consolidate my strengths, clarify my professional goals and values, and become more employable in the field of computer science.

## Collaborating in a Team Environment

In **CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle**, I rotated through Agile roles—Developer, Product Owner, Tester, and Scrum Master—actively participating 
in daily scrums, iterative planning, and backlog refinement. This experience taught me that collaboration thrives on clear communication, shared 
understanding of goals, and iterative feedback loops. I learned to adapt my communication style to different audiences within the team, effectively 
support decision-making, and ensure that all members worked toward a common objective.

## Communicating with Stakeholders

In **CS 319 UI/UX Design and Development**, I explored how users might interact with systems in global environments, referencing an organization like 
Kiva, which extends microloans worldwide. Proposing cloud-based applications accessible even where users rely only on embedded systems pushed me to 
communicate technical concepts clearly and persuasively to stakeholders with varying technical backgrounds. This taught me to adapt my message to the 
audience’s needs, ensuring that decision-makers understand how proposed solutions align with their strategic goals and constraints.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

Developing algorithmic reasoning skills was central to my growth. In **CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms**, I worked extensively with data 
structures like hash tables, trees, stacks, and queues. Implementing a quicksort algorithm for large CSV datasets reinforced how to choose 
appropriate structures and algorithms to balance performance and complexity.

Later, in **CS 370 Current/Emerging Trends in CS**, I applied machine learning algorithms and trained an agent to navigate and find treasures 
efficiently. Balancing accuracy, speed, and data quality taught me to manage trade-offs and think critically about algorithmic approaches, ensuring 
solutions remain robust, efficient, and adaptable.

## Software Engineering and Databases

My understanding of software engineering principles and database integration matured significantly in **CS 465 Full Stack I** and **CS 470 Full Stack 
II**. In Full Stack I, using a MEAN stack allowed me to transform static sites into single-page applications (SPAs), delivering seamless user 
experiences. Meanwhile, Full Stack II introduced me to AWS services, including DynamoDB, as well as containerization and orchestration with Docker. 
These experiences showed me how modern development workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and scalable architectures support building solutions that deliver 
real value.

I learned that thoughtful schema design, integration of APIs, and leveraging cloud infrastructure are critical skills in today’s industry.

## Security Mindset

In **CS 305 Software Security**, I focused on security considerations through various scenarios, including one involving a fictional company, Artemis 
Financial. I learned to anticipate potential adversarial exploits and integrate security best practices into the design phase of software 
development. By encrypting data both at rest and in transit, implementing RSA encryption, validating inputs, and using secure dependencies, I ensured 
that my solutions would protect both users and organizations effectively. This experience reinforced the idea that security should not be an 
afterthought; rather, it must be embedded throughout the entire development lifecycle.

## Integrating Artifacts and Demonstrating Growth

My ePortfolio includes both the original text-based *House Cleaning Adventure* game and an enhanced version featuring a GUI, database integration, 
and advanced algorithms like A* pathfinding. These artifacts, combined with my experiences in Agile collaboration, stakeholder communication, 
algorithmic reasoning, full-stack development, and security, present a comprehensive picture of my abilities. Each skill complements the others and 
demonstrates my readiness to contribute meaningfully in a professional environment.

I have grown from a novice developer into a well-rounded computing professional who can collaborate effectively, communicate clearly, design and 
implement robust solutions, use industry-standard tools, and maintain a vigilant security stance. This journey has equipped me with the competencies 
to meet real-world challenges and add value to organizations.
