# Professional Self-Assessment

As I near the completion of the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have taken the opportunity to reflect on the capstone experience and the journey that led me here. Throughout my education, I transitioned from writing simple scripts to developing well-structured, secure, and efficient applications demonstrating deep technical knowledge and professional readiness. Completing my coursework and assembling this ePortfolio has helped me consolidate my strengths, clarify my professional goals and values, and become more employable in the field of computer science.
Collaborating in a Team Environment:
In the CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle, I rotated through Agile roles—Developer, Product Owner, Tester, and Scrum Master—actively participating in daily scrums, iterative planning, and backlog refinement. This experience taught me that collaboration thrives on clear communication, shared understanding of goals, and iterative feedback loops. I learned to adapt my communication style to different audiences within the team, effectively support decision-making, and ensure that all members worked toward a common objective.
Communicating with Stakeholders:
In CS-319 UI/UX Design and Development, I explored how users might interact with systems in global environments, referencing an organization like Kiva, which extends microloans worldwide. Proposing cloud-based applications accessible even where users rely on embedded systems pushed me to communicate technical concepts clearly and persuasively to stakeholders with varying technical backgrounds. This taught me to adapt my message to the audience’s needs, ensuring that decision-makers understand how proposed solutions align with their strategic goals and constraints.
Data Structures and Algorithms:
Developing algorithmic reasoning skills was central to my growth. In CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms, I worked extensively with data structures like hash tables, trees, stacks, and queues. Implementing a quicksort algorithm for large CSV datasets reinforced how to choose appropriate structures and algorithms to balance performance and complexity. Later, in  CS- 370 Current/Emerging Trends in CS, I applied machine learning algorithms and trained an agent to navigate and find treasures efficiently. Balancing accuracy, speed, and data quality taught me to manage trade-offs and think critically about algorithmic approaches, ensuring solutions remain robust, efficient, and adaptable.
Software Engineering and Databases:
My understanding of software engineering principles and database integration matured significantly in CS-465 Full Stack I and CS-470  Full Stack II. In Full Stack I, using a MEAN stack allowed me to transform static sites into single-page applications (SPAs), delivering seamless user experiences. Meanwhile, Full Stack II introduced me to AWS services, including DynamoDB, as well as containerization and orchestration with Docker. These experiences showed me how modern development workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and scalable architectures support building solutions that deliver real value. I learned that thoughtful schema design, integration of APIs, and leveraging cloud infrastructure are critical skills in today’s industry.
Security Mindset:
Security considerations were highlighted in CS-305 Software Security. Through scenarios like working with a fictional Artemis Financial, I learned to anticipate adversarial exploits and integrate security best practices into the design phase. By encrypting data at rest and in transit, implementing RSA encryption, validating inputs, and using secure dependencies, I ensured that my solutions protect both users and organizations. This reinforced that security is not an afterthought—it must be embedded throughout the development lifecycle.
Integrating Artifacts and Demonstrating Growth:
My ePortfolio includes both the original text-based House Cleaning Adventure game and an enhanced version featuring a GUI, database integration, and advanced algorithms like A* pathfinding. These artifacts, combined with my experiences in Agile collaboration, stakeholder communication, algorithmic reasoning, full-stack development, and security, present a comprehensive picture of my abilities. Each skill complements the others and demonstrates my readiness to contribute meaningfully in a professional environment.
I have grown from a novice developer into a well-rounded computing professional who can collaborate effectively, communicate clearly, design and implement robust solutions, use industry-standard tools, and maintain a vigilant security stance. This journey has equipped me with the competencies to meet real-world challenges and add value to organizations.
