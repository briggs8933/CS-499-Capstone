# Course Outcomes Alignment

Below is how my House Cleaning Adventure enhancements align with the key course outcomes.

## Course Outcome Alignment (House Cleaning Adventure Enhancements)

After completing all enhancements to the House Cleaning Adventure artifact, these modifications clearly align with and demonstrate the core Computer Science course outcomes:

### 1. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science

**Demonstrated Through:**  
- The game’s refactored, modular code structure, thorough documentation, and code review process.
- By organizing classes into separate files (for rooms, agents, and database interactions) and adding docstrings, I’ve made the codebase understandable and maintainable for future collaborators.
- Clear comments and logical structure enable smoother collaboration and better-informed decisions among stakeholders and developers.

### 2. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts

**Demonstrated Through:**  
- The addition of a graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame and supporting narratives (documentation and the code review video).
- The GUI transforms the text-based game into a visually accessible application, catering to non-technical stakeholders and end-users.
- The code review video and written narratives provide technically sound explanations, ensuring both technical and non-technical audiences understand the enhancements and their significance.

### 3. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices

**Demonstrated Through:**  
- The integration of A* pathfinding for the in-game agent.
- Implementing this algorithm required considering algorithmic complexity, selecting appropriate data structures, and balancing performance against code complexity.
- These trade-offs—such as choosing a suitable heuristic or ensuring efficient pathfinding—reflect a deep understanding of algorithmic principles, problem-solving techniques, and standard coding practices.

### 4. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals

**Demonstrated Through:**  
- Employing new tools and frameworks such as Pygame for the GUI and SQLite for persistent data storage.
- Going beyond basic scripting to leverage industry-relevant technologies.
- Introducing a database schema to manage user accounts, high scores, and game states adds tangible value to the artifact, making it more engaging and professionally reflective of modern industry standards.

### 5. Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources

**Demonstrated Through:**  
- Implementing password hashing, input validation, and parameterized database queries.
- Protecting user data from common security threats (e.g., SQL injection, credential theft).
- Proactively embedding security measures into database integration and user authentication features shows a preventative security mindset that anticipates and mitigates vulnerabilities before exploitation.
