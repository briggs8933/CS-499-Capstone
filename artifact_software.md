# Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

For this enhancement, I revisited my **IT 140** text-based game, *House Cleaning Adventure*, originally created almost two years ago. Including this artifact in my ePortfolio allows me to demonstrate my growth from a simple, text-based script to a more professional and maintainable application. By integrating modern tools and improved coding practices, I’ve transformed the game into a more user-friendly, scalable solution.

**Key Changes:**
- Introduced a GUI using Pygame, replacing text-based commands with arrow keys and spacebar actions.
- Refactored the code into modular classes and separate files (e.g., `room.py`, `player.py`, `utils.py`, `constants.py`), improving maintainability and scalability.
- Added docstrings, comments, and logical naming conventions for clearer code communication.

**Outcome Alignment:**
- **Outcome 1:** The first enhancement best demonstrates building collaborative environments. Modular code and thorough documentation enable easy understanding and future teamwork.
- **Outcome 2:** The GUI and improved code clarity allow both technical and non-technical audiences to interact with and understand the project.
- **Outcome 4:** Using Pygame and adopting industry-standard architectural practices show my ability to implement well-founded, value-driven solutions.
- **Outcome 5:** Initial design choices ensure the interface won’t expose data layers prematurely, considering security from the start.

**Reflections:**
This stage taught me the importance of planning a robust foundation for future enhancements. Although I could not implement every idea immediately, focusing on modularity and user experience sets a strong baseline for upcoming improvements.
