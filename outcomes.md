# Course Outcomes Alignment

Below is how my House Cleaning Adventure enhancements align with the key course outcomes:

Course Outcome Alignment (House Cleaning Adventure Enhancements)
After completing all enhancements to the House Cleaning Adventure artifact, these modifications clearly align with and demonstrate the core Computer Science course outcomes:
1. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science:
	•	Demonstrated Through: The game’s refactored, modular code structure, thorough documentation, and the code review process. By organizing classes into separate files (rooms, agents, database interactions) and adding docstrings, I’ve made the codebase understandable and maintainable for future collaborators. Clear comments and logical structure set the stage for easy onboarding of new team members, enabling smoother collaboration and better-informed decisions among stakeholders and developers.
2. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts:
	•	Demonstrated Through: The addition of a graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame and the supporting narratives (documentation and code review video). The GUI transforms a text-based game into a visually accessible application, catering to non-technical stakeholders and end-users. The code review video and written narratives offer technically sound explanations of the enhancements, ensuring that both technical and non-technical audiences understand the improvements and their significance.
3. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices:
	•	Demonstrated Through: The integration of A* pathfinding for the in-game agent. Implementing this algorithm required considering algorithmic complexity, selecting appropriate data structures, and balancing performance against code complexity. These trade-offs—such as choosing a suitable heuristic or ensuring that pathfinding runs efficiently without disrupting the game’s responsiveness—reflect a deep understanding of algorithmic principles, problem-solving techniques, and standard coding practices.
4. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals:
	•	Demonstrated Through: Employing new tools and frameworks such as Pygame for the GUI and SQLite for persistent data storage. These enhancements show that I can go beyond basic scripting and leverage industry-relevant technologies. The introduction of a database schema to manage user accounts, high scores, and game states is a well-founded technique that aligns with real-world applications, adding tangible value to the artifact by creating a more engaging and professional experience reflective of modern industry standards.
5. Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources:
	•	Demonstrated Through: Implementing password hashing, input validation, and parameterized database queries ensures that user data is protected from common security threats (e.g., SQL injection, credential theft). By proactively embedding security measures into the database integration and user authentication features, I have approached the artifact’s development with a preventative security mindset—one that anticipates vulnerabilities and mitigates them before they can be exploited.
